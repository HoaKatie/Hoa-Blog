        <h2>Visit Ba Ho Waterfall</h2>
        <p>Located around an hour’s drive to the north of Nha Trang, Ba Ho Waterfall actually consists of three separate and equally scenic cascades that lie along a fast-flowing river surrounded by dense jungle. The rugged rocks that line the falls and jut out from the thick forest make for an incredible sight. Some brave visitors even dive off the first waterfall’s craggy clifftop into the pool below.</p>
        <p>Meaning ‘waterfall with three basins’ in Vietnamese, Ba Ho’s outstanding beauty makes it a perfect place to visit for nature lovers. There is also a great hike you can do along the river and through the jungle to reach the other two falls.</p>

        <p>Lying on the banks of the Cai River, the well-preserved remains of the Po Nagar Towers certainly make for an impressive sight, and it is not without reason that they are one of the most popular attractions in Nha Trang. With some of them dating all the way back to before 780 AD, the four remaining towers represent some of the finest examples of the incredible architecture that the once-mighty Cham Kingdom left behind.</p>
        <p>In addition to the fabulous brickwork of the towers, there are some lovely stone statues and altars for you to check out, with lots of intricately carved inscriptions also on show. Dedicated to the goddess of the country – Yan Po Nagar – the site is still in use to this day. When you visit, you’ll find a mix of Buddhists, Cham, Chinese, and Vietnamese all worshipping amongst the magnificent old temples, columns, and meditation halls that dot the complex.</p>

        <h2>Visit Long Son Pagoda</h2>
        <p>Speaking of temples, no visit to Nha Trang can ever be complete without stopping by the Long Son Pagoda – the most famous and impressive Buddhist temple in town. Built in 1886, the pagoda is very striking to gaze upon: majestic dragon mosaics cover the roof and entrance while its interior boasts an impressive ceremonial hall.</p>
        <p>The main feature, however, is its glistening white Buddha statue that towers to a colossal 24 meters. As Long Son Pagoda is set upon a hilltop, many people come here to take in the fantastic views that it offers of the rest of Nha Trang while basking in the peaceful ambiance and taking in the astounding architecture all around them.</p>

        <h2>Visit Monkey Island</h2>
        <p>Located a short and scenic ferry ride away from Nha Trang, Monkey Island is so named due to the thousand or so monkeys that inhabit it. Bred for export to the Soviet Union, the program was abandoned during the American War, and now the mischievous primates can be spotted almost everywhere you go.</p>
        <p>Besides seeing what monkey business they get up to, visitors can lounge on the beach and take in the peaceful ambiance, or go swimming, kayaking, jet-skiing, or scuba diving in the surrounding waters. On top of all this, there are a couple of lovely shops and cafes for you to check out, as well as a fun go-kart track to race around.</p>
