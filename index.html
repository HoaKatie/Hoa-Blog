        <h1>Introduce to you the Amazing Vietnam</h1>
        <p>The culture of Vietnam is one of the oldest in Southeast Asia, with the Bronze Age Đông Sơn culture considered to be one of its most important progenitors for its Ancient history. Vietnamese culture was heavily influenced by Chinese culture due to the 1000 years of Northern rule.</p>

          <h4>Submerge yourself in many beautiful lakes</h4>
          <p>There are many beautiful lakes in Vietnam. There are natural lakes, but there are also a lot of lakes formed by dams to generate electricity. As a result, rivers have turned into huge lakes, and hill and mountain peaks have turned into islands in these lakes. One thing is for sure, it gives an impressive view.</p>
          <p> A trip to Vietnam is not all about crystal clear beaches, majestic mountainous areas, or yummy dishes, the country has more on offer. With a large number of natural lakes scattered from The North to The South, visitors can have a total getaway from the daily hustles.</p>

          <h4>How Vietnamese commute</h4>
          <p>Motorbikes have been a valuable asset to the Vietnamese for decades, not only as a means of transportation but also as a way of making a living. This is so common for locals, but foreigners are always very surprised by the immense numbers of motorbikes on their first Vietnam visit. Saying motorbikes are a huge part of the Vietnamese culture isn’t an exaggeration at all, people use motorbikes for commuting, taking their children to school, carrying goods for business or providing services for daily income.</p>

          <h4>The vibrant streetfood</h4>
          <p>Vietnam is one of the world’s best street-food destinations, offering the promise of bold and diverse flavors without ever stepping foot inside a restaurant. Care to chomp down on some grilled corn doused in green onion oil or a steaming bowl of wonton noodle soup, washed down with an ice-cold glass of freshly squeezed sugar-cane and kumquat juice? Welcome to Vietnam’s glorious street-food scene.</p>
