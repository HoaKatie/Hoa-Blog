          <h1>Don't be shy, come to Hue</h1>
          <p>Located on the banks of the Perfume River which winds its way through town, Hue is a delightful city to visit with loads of things to see and do. As the former capital of Vietnam, it is dripping in history and Hue is particularly renowned for the beautiful tombs of former emperors that are scattered about here and there.</p>
          <p>Full of life, it was tragically the site of one of the Vietnam War’s most brutal battles, and remnants of the fighting can still be seen to this day in the damaged monuments and temples around town. Nowadays Hue is a laid-back place that has some delicious cuisine on offer, and the friendly and welcoming locals will certainly make you feel at home right away.</p>

      <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">About Hue</h1>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">Hue is best known for its imperial citadel, royal mausoleums, and iconic pagodas. Not only a favorite destination for architectural enthusiasts, but Hue also makes a mecca for gastronomes in Vietnam. The city boasts a rich and fantastic cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Visit the Hue Imperial City - The last dynasty of Vietnam</h2>
        <p>The Imperial was built in 1362 and in 1993 was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Between these two periods of time, the walls of the city have witnessed a lot of history. It even served as the capital of Vietnam from 1802 to 1945 during the reign of the Nguyen dynasty.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, Gia Long was the first emperor of the Nguyen dynasty. He made this dynasty with questionable tactics of blood and attacking those other emperors and rulers in the region. The goal was to take over their land and unite them all into one single empire, which he was ultimately successful at.</p>
        <p>This dynasty would be the last in Vietnam and would rule for 143 years. The city of Hue would be the capital and there was a reason they choose Hue as their base. Supposedly the river and mountains that surround Hue looked like snakes and lions, well at least it did according to the geomancers. It would be the perfect location to recreate a version of the Forbidden City of Beijing.</p>
        <p>With that become the process of building the enormous complex envisioned. A 10-kilometer moat was dug on the outside with each 2 kilometers long and 6-meter high wall enclosing the square fortress we call the Imperial City of Hue.
          On the inside was everything you would expect of a country’s capital. From offices, palaces to residences and gardens. Though, the most important part was built in the middle, The Purple Forbidden City. This is where the emperor and those closest to him would live and work.</p>

        <h2>Buy food at Dong Ba Market</h2>
        <p>The largest commercial center in the province, Dong Ba Market is a busy place full of life and energy, and is the perfect market at which to buy anything from local produce and handmade artisan goods to jewelry, clothing and more.
          With lots of food courts dotted about here and there, it is also a lovely spot to grab a bite to eat and simply watch the world go by.</p>

        <h2>Visit Tu Dam Pagoda</h2>
        <p>Built in the late seventeenth century, this lovely Buddhist temple has expanded a lot over the years, although the Vietnam War means left some parts still remain damaged, and they have remained unrepaired to this day. With the seven-tiered pagoda being its defining feature, the pagoda is still inhabited by monks who keep it neat and tidy.
          The large courtyard is overlooked by a huge bodhi tree, and every year the Buddha’s birthday attracts thousands upon thousands of people who come to worship him at the Tu Dam Pagoda.</p>

        <h2>Walk on Thanh Toan Bridge</h2>
        <p>Also known as the Japanese Bridge, Thanh Toan is a quaint and pretty bridge, although there is not much else near it that will be of interest to visitors. Tran Thi Dao commissioned it to help facilitate travel and communication between a small secluded village and the wider world, which until then had been separated by the canal that the bridge now spans.</p>
        <p>When Tran Thi Dao died childless, the emperor ordered the villagers to put up an altar at the bridge and pray to her when they passed by. In Vietnam, ancestor worship is still very important, and the villagers still pray to her today. With its distinctive rickety look, the Japanese Bridge is a nice place to stop by although it won’t take you very long to explore.</p>

        <h2>Go see tomb of Tu Duc</h2>
        <p>Lying atop Van Nien Hill, the tomb of Tu Duc is surrounded by forest, and there is a lovely pavilion with a water lily-coated pond for visitors to enjoy. Built between 1864 and 1867, the tomb was designed by the emperor himself, and it cost so much money and used so much forced labor that it actually triggered a coup against him.</p>
        <p>While the complex is pretty to behold, the tomb itself is not that special, and Tu Duc was never actually interned there. The temples, statues and outer courtyard, however, are very nice to wander around, making Tu Duc’s tomb worth checking out.</p>
